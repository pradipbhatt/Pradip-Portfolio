## About Me
### My Introduction

🪄☔ Magic 🪄☔

I'm Pradip Bhatt, a computer science and engineering student at Far Western University, driven by a passion for hackathons and coding competitions. I've contributed to web projects and explored front-end design while venturing into Python for AI development. Hailing from Nepal's remote Farwest region, I navigate challenges but remain dedicated to coding and collaborative learning.

I recently organized Ideathon 2023 and joined a transformative GitHub field visit. Beyond coding, I find joy in photography, image editing, design, and exploring new horizons. ☂️🌍📸💻
